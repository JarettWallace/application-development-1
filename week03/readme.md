* package.json is used as a way to store information for applications, modules, and packages. Without json any applications made will not function properlly.

* Process.env is a global object in node.js that both stores variables and provides access to them at the same time.

* npm start is a command in a package.json file that is normally used to start an application. When it is ran it will look for a "start" script in the json file and will execute the command that is tied to the start

* I kept running into an error when attempting to run npm start that kept saying "node version: ProcessInstruction.version);. I threw this eroor along with my code into Chatgpt to try and help figure out what was causing it, as it turns out autopilot which i cant fiigure out how to turn off in VS kept changing process into Processing and that is what kept causing me to have errors in my code
